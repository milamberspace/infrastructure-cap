# CAP Backend

Python backend for the ASF Infra Contingent Approval Provider (CAP).
See [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the full design. This README is the
operator-facing summary: how to run it, what it currently exposes,
and where to look when something is off.

## Quick start

```bash
# install / sync dependencies into .venv
uv sync --extra dev

# run the server (defaults to http://0.0.0.0:8085)
uv run cap-backend

# run with a specific config file
uv run cap-backend --config ./config.yaml
```

The config file path is resolved in this order:

1. `--config <path>` CLI argument
2. `CAP_CONFIG` environment variable
3. `./config.yaml` in the working directory
4. `/etc/cap/config.yaml`

A starter `config.yaml` lives in this directory; copy it before
editing for a real deployment.

## What is implemented

The current iteration ships the full CAP workflow except the
public-permalink read endpoint. Everything below is wired end to end:
HTTP route, Pydantic-validated request/response, audit-log row in
the same SQLite transaction, mailing-list email after commit, and
pubsub event tailed from the audit log.

### HTTP endpoints

All backend routes are namespaced under the `/api/` prefix. The
asfquart-owned OAuth gateway at `/auth` is the one exception (it has
to be reachable without a session in order to perform the login
handshake).

| Method   | Path                           | Auth  | Scope    | Purpose                                            |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/api`                     | none  | n/a      | OpenAPI 3.x document for the whole service         |
| `GET`    | `/api/docs`                    | none  | n/a      | Swagger UI rendering of `/api/api` (SPEC §9.10)    |
| `GET`    | `/api/publist`                 | none  | n/a      | Public feed of non-private questions (SPEC §9.13)  |
| `GET`    | `/auth`                        | none  | n/a      | asfquart OAuth gateway (login / logout handshake)  |
| `GET`    | `/api/list`                    | yes   | `public` | Open questions visible to the caller (SPEC §9.1)   |
| `POST`   | `/api/question`                | yes   | `ask`    | Create a new question (SPEC §9.2)                  |
| `GET`    | `/api/question/{id}`           | yes   | `public` | Fetch one question plus all responses (SPEC §9.3)  |
| `PATCH`  | `/api/question/{id}`           | yes   | `ask`    | Edit an open question's metadata (SPEC §9.4)       |
| `DELETE` | `/api/question/{id}`           | yes   | `ask`    | Withdraw an open question (SPEC §9.5)              |
| `POST`   | `/api/question/{id}/resolve`   | yes   | `ask`    | Finalize the tally and issue the permalink (§9.6)  |
| `POST`   | `/api/question/{id}/responses` | yes   | `answer` | Submit / amend a response (SPEC §9.7)              |
| `GET`    | `/api/token`                   | OAuth | n/a      | Issue a personal-access bearer token (SPEC §9.12)  |

`/api/api`, `/api/docs`, and `/api/publist` are the only public
routes; every other path is gated by the global authentication hook,
which redirects browser clients to `/api/auth?login=<return-path>`
and returns `401` JSON to API clients. Endpoints listed by Swagger UI
at `/api/docs` are still auth-gated when invoked via "Try it out".

### Authentication and scopes

Authenticated callers come in two flavors:

- **OAuth sessions**, established via the `/auth` gateway. These hold
  every scope implicitly, and are the only sessions allowed to issue
  new personal-access tokens.
- **Bearer-token sessions**, established by sending
  `Authorization: bearer <token>` against any route. asfquart resolves
  the token through `APP.token_handler`, which `cap_backend/app.py`
  wires to an in-memory `TokenStore`. Token sessions are restricted to
  the scopes recorded at issuance time (currently always `["ask"]`).

The scope check happens inline in each handler: a token whose scope
list does not include the route's required scope receives `403` with
body `{"error": "insufficient_scope", "required_scope": "<scope>"}`.
The `public` scope is granted to every authenticated caller and is
the catch-all for read-only endpoints.

### Personal access tokens (`GET /api/token`)

A logged-in user calls `GET /api/token` to mint a fresh bearer token.
The response includes the token string (shown exactly once), the
issued scope list (always `["ask"]`), the creation timestamp, and an
absolute expiry 24 hours later. Constraints:

- Tokens live only in process memory. Restarts and process recycles
  invalidate every outstanding token.
- A single ASF UID may hold at most five live tokens at any moment.
  Issuing a sixth evicts the oldest in FIFO order.
- Token sessions cannot themselves issue further tokens: an attempt
  receives `403 token_session_cannot_issue`.
- Token holders can create, edit, withdraw, and resolve questions
  (scope `ask`) plus read public-scope endpoints, but they cannot
  submit responses (which require the `answer` scope).

### Side effects, automatic on every state change

- **Audit log.** Every `POST` / `PATCH` / `DELETE` writes one row
  to `audit_log` in the same SQLite transaction as the table-level
  change. The log is append-only and is the source of truth for
  the pubsub publisher.
- **Email.** After the transaction commits, the route dispatches a
  notification through `asfpy.messaging.mail`. Public questions
  route to `dev@{project}.apache.org`; private questions route to
  `private@{project}.apache.org`. Delivery failures are logged but
  never roll back a committed state change.
- **Pubsub.** A background coroutine (`cap_backend/pubsub.py`)
  tails `audit_log` by `audit_id` and POSTs one JSON event per
  row to `{pubsub.base_url}[/private]/question/{type}/{project}/{id}`.
  Cursor state lives in the `pubsub_cursor` table, so restarts
  resume cleanly. Failures pause with exponential backoff up to
  60 s and never advance the cursor, giving at-least-once
  delivery in `audit_id` order. The publisher is gated on
  `pubsub.enabled` in `config.yaml`.

## What is not implemented yet

- `GET /api/resolution/{id}` (SPEC §9.8). The permalink string is
  already written into `questions.permalink` at resolve time, but
  the read endpoint that serves it is deferred to the next
  iteration.

## Persistence

SQLite 3 in WAL mode at the path given by `database.path` in
`config.yaml`. The schema is materialized on first launch via
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (see `cap_backend/sql/schema.sql`).
Tables: `questions`, `responses`, `audit_log`, `pubsub_cursor`.

## Configuration

`config.yaml` is documented in SPEC §5.1. The fields that matter
operationally:

- `server.permalink_base` — production should set this to the
  public host so `permalink` values render as
  `https://cap.apache.org/api/resolution/{id}`. Defaults to empty,
  yielding bare paths (handy in dev).
- `server.publist_cache_seconds` — max age, in seconds, of the
  in-process cache that backs `/api/publist` (SPEC §9.13). Default
  `30`; `0` disables caching so every request recomputes. The
  endpoint's `Cache-Control` header mirrors this value.
- `database.path` — absolute or relative path to the SQLite file.
  The parent directory must exist and be writable.
- `pubsub.enabled` — set to `false` to disable the background
  publisher entirely (events still accumulate in `audit_log` and
  drain when the publisher is re-enabled).
- `pubsub.basic_auth` — username/password for posting to private
  topics. Without credentials, private events are skipped (with a
  `WARNING` log line) while public events continue to be
  delivered.
- `CAP_PUBSUB_PASSWORD` — environment override for
  `pubsub.basic_auth.password`, so the password never has to live
  in the YAML file.

## Development

```bash
# lint
uv run ruff check .

# tests
uv run pytest
```

CI runs the same `ruff check` and `pytest` on every push and PR
(see `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`).
