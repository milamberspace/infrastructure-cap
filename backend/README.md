# CAP Backend

Python backend for the ASF Infra Contingent Approval Provider (CAP).
See [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the full design. This README is the
operator-facing summary: how to run it, what it currently exposes,
and where to look when something is off.

## Quick start

```bash
# install / sync dependencies into .venv
uv sync --extra dev

# run the server (defaults to http://0.0.0.0:8085)
uv run cap-backend

# run with a specific config file
uv run cap-backend --config ./config.yaml
```

The config file path is resolved in this order:

1. `--config <path>` CLI argument
2. `CAP_CONFIG` environment variable
3. `./config.yaml` in the working directory
4. `/etc/cap/config.yaml`

A starter `config.yaml` lives in this directory; copy it before
editing for a real deployment.

## What is implemented

The current iteration ships the full CAP workflow except the
public-permalink read endpoint. Everything below is wired end to end:
HTTP route, Pydantic-validated request/response, audit-log row in
the same SQLite transaction, mailing-list email after commit, and
pubsub event tailed from the audit log.

### HTTP endpoints

| Method   | Path                       | Auth | Purpose                                            |
|----------|----------------------------|------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api`                     | none | OpenAPI 3.x document for the whole service         |
| `GET`    | `/docs`                    | none | Swagger UI rendering of `/api` (SPEC §9.10)        |
| `GET`    | `/auth`                    | none | asfquart OAuth gateway (login / logout handshake)  |
| `GET`    | `/list`                    | yes  | Open questions visible to the caller (SPEC §9.1)   |
| `POST`   | `/question`                | yes  | Create a new question (SPEC §9.2)                  |
| `GET`    | `/question/{id}`           | yes  | Fetch one question plus all responses (SPEC §9.3)  |
| `PATCH`  | `/question/{id}`           | yes  | Edit an open question's metadata (SPEC §9.4)       |
| `DELETE` | `/question/{id}`           | yes  | Withdraw an open question (SPEC §9.5)              |
| `POST`   | `/question/{id}/resolve`   | yes  | Finalize the tally and issue the permalink (§9.6)  |
| `POST`   | `/question/{id}/responses` | yes  | Submit / amend a response (SPEC §9.7)              |

`/api` and `/docs` are the only public routes; every other path is
gated by the global authentication hook, which redirects browser
clients to `/auth?login=<return-path>` and returns `401` JSON to API
clients. Endpoints listed by Swagger UI at `/docs` are still
auth-gated when invoked via "Try it out".

### Side effects, automatic on every state change

- **Audit log.** Every `POST` / `PATCH` / `DELETE` writes one row
  to `audit_log` in the same SQLite transaction as the table-level
  change. The log is append-only and is the source of truth for
  the pubsub publisher.
- **Email.** After the transaction commits, the route dispatches a
  notification through `asfpy.messaging.mail`. Public questions
  route to `dev@{project}.apache.org`; private questions route to
  `private@{project}.apache.org`. Delivery failures are logged but
  never roll back a committed state change.
- **Pubsub.** A background coroutine (`cap_backend/pubsub.py`)
  tails `audit_log` by `audit_id` and POSTs one JSON event per
  row to `{pubsub.base_url}[/private]/question/{type}/{project}/{id}`.
  Cursor state lives in the `pubsub_cursor` table, so restarts
  resume cleanly. Failures pause with exponential backoff up to
  60 s and never advance the cursor, giving at-least-once
  delivery in `audit_id` order. The publisher is gated on
  `pubsub.enabled` in `config.yaml`.

## What is not implemented yet

- `GET /resolution/{id}` (SPEC §9.8). The permalink string is
  already written into `questions.permalink` at resolve time, but
  the read endpoint that serves it is deferred to the next
  iteration.

## Persistence

SQLite 3 in WAL mode at the path given by `database.path` in
`config.yaml`. The schema is materialized on first launch via
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (see `cap_backend/sql/schema.sql`).
Tables: `questions`, `responses`, `audit_log`, `pubsub_cursor`.

## Configuration

`config.yaml` is documented in SPEC §5.1. The fields that matter
operationally:

- `server.permalink_base` — production should set this to the
  public host so `permalink` values render as
  `https://cap.apache.org/resolution/{id}`. Defaults to empty,
  yielding bare paths (handy in dev).
- `database.path` — absolute or relative path to the SQLite file.
  The parent directory must exist and be writable.
- `pubsub.enabled` — set to `false` to disable the background
  publisher entirely (events still accumulate in `audit_log` and
  drain when the publisher is re-enabled).
- `pubsub.basic_auth` — username/password for posting to private
  topics. Without credentials, private events are skipped (with a
  `WARNING` log line) while public events continue to be
  delivered.
- `CAP_PUBSUB_PASSWORD` — environment override for
  `pubsub.basic_auth.password`, so the password never has to live
  in the YAML file.

## Development

```bash
# lint
uv run ruff check .

# tests
uv run pytest
```

CI runs the same `ruff check` and `pytest` on every push and PR
(see `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`).
