"""Email notifications for question lifecycle events.

Every state-changing action on a question (create / edit / resolve / remove /
respond) sends a notification to the relevant project mailing list. The
recipient list is determined entirely by the question's ``project_id`` and
``is_private`` flag, so neither route handlers nor callers need to know
anything about list naming.

The sender is constant across every event so subscribers can filter on it:

    From: ASF Contingent Approval Platform <root-asfcap@apache.org>

The dispatch is delegated to ``asfpy.messaging.mail``. We import it lazily
inside ``send()`` so the module remains importable in test environments that
do not have a configured MSA, and so tests can monkeypatch the dispatch
function without touching SMTP.
