    About the Contingent Approval Platform
  </h1>

  <section class="mb-4">
    <p>
      The <strong>Contingent Approval Platform</strong> (or CAP for short) is
      a foundation-wide service that captures and records the technical
      decisions taken by projects and services at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
      Wherever a project or service needs to ask a binary or graded question of a community
      (a release vote, a committee sign-off, a lazy consensus on a
      configuration change, an approval for a sensitive operation, etc.), CAP
      can provide a canonical place to file the question, gather the
      responses, and record the outcome with a permanent resolution link.
    </p>

    <p>
      CAP models every decision as a <em>question</em> with a fixed
      <em>response option</em> (a vote, a lazy consensus, or a free-text
      response), a <em>target audience</em>, a <em>scope</em> (the project
      the question is filed against, and optionally a privacy flag for
      committee-only questions), and a hard <em>closes_at</em> deadline.
      Every state-changing action against a question, from the initial
      filing through each individual response to the final resolution, is
      written to an append-only <strong>audit log</strong> inside the same
      database transaction as the action itself. The audit trail and MFA
      requirements of CAP lends better security assurances for project
      decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      CAP distinguishes <strong>binding</strong> votes (votes from members
      of the project's management committee) from non-binding votes, and
      enforces that distinction at tally time. The tally rules vary by
      approval type: a unanimous-approval question is decided by whether
      any binding voter holds a veto, a majority-approval question by
      counting binding votes, and a lazy-consensus question by whether
      any objection (binding or not) has been raised in the window. The
      rules are fixed in code so that every project sees the same
      determinstic process, logic, and arithmetic.
    </p>

    <p>
      External services can <strong>outsource their decision-recording
      logic to CAP</strong>. Rather than reinventing voting plumbing
      inside every tool that needs a sign-off, a service files a question
      through CAP's HTTP API, subscribes to the pubsub event stream (or
      polls the resolution endpoint), and asynchronously proceeds once
      CAP reports the outcome. The Apache Trusted Release service (ATR),
      <code>.asf.yaml</code> automation, and other infrastructure tools
      are candidate consumers; see <a href="#external-services">External
      services</a> below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The long-term goal is a more <strong>uniform and user-friendly</strong>
      decision-making process across all Apache projects, and across most
      of the services they rely on: one user interface, one audit format,
      one event stream, and a single canonical permalink for every
      recorded outcome.
    </p>

    The diagram below walks through the lifecycle of a question, from the

    The common flow is the same across all approval types; the three

    <em>lazy consensus</em>.

    Integrating external services
  </h2>

  <p>
    CAP is designed to act as a shared decision-recording backend for
    other Apache infrastructure. The HTTP API and the pubsub event
    stream together provide everything an automated workflow needs to
    file a question, wait for a verdict, and resume on the outcome,
    without having to host its own voting machinery.
  </p>

  <p>
    A typical integration looks like this:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The external service decides it needs an approval (for example,
      ATR (<a href="{ATR_URL}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{ATR_URL}</a>)
      detects that a release candidate is ready for a PMC vote, or a
      <code>.asf.yaml</code> workflow detects a change that requires a
      committee sign-off).
    </li>
    <li>
      It calls <code>POST /api/question</code> with the question body,
      using an ASF personal access token issued by
      <code>GET /api/token</code>. The question carries a
      <code>request_id</code> generated by the calling service so the
      service can correlate the future verdict back to its own state.
    </li>
    <li>
      The service either subscribes to the CAP pubsub topic for that
      project, or polls
      <code>GET /api/resolution/&#123;question_id&#125;</code> at a slow
      cadence. The pubsub path is preferred; it delivers the
      <code>question.resolved</code> event as soon as the tally has
      been recorded, so the service can react with no polling lag.
    </li>
    <li>
      On <code>question.resolved</code>, the service reads the outcome
      and the resolution permalink, then asynchronously proceeds with
      the original operation (publish the release, merge the change,
      apply the config, whichever it was waiting on). The permalink
      is included in any downstream notification so reviewers can
      trace the operation back to the decision that authorized it.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Because CAP is the system of record for the decision, the calling
    service does not need to store the vote tally itself. It records
    only its own state (waiting on question X, proceeded after
    question X resolved as Y) and a link to the CAP permalink. This
    keeps the calling service simple and ensures every project sees
    the same vote semantics regardless of which tool initiated the
    question.
  </p>

  <p>
    A non-exhaustive list of services that are expected to integrate
    with CAP over time:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ATR</strong>, the Apache Trusted Release service
      (<a href="{ATR_URL}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{ATR_URL}</a>),
      for release-vote workflows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>.asf.yaml</strong> automation, for committee approvals on
      sensitive repository configuration changes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Infrastructure self-service tooling, for committee sign-off on
      operations that today rely on bespoke INFRA tickets and ad-hoc
      mailing-list threads.
    </li>
  </ul>
